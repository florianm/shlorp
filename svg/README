This package provides a command similar to the \includegraphics command of the 
graphicx package, but for the inclusion of SVGs using Inkscape.

     \includesvg[<options>]{<svg filename>}

A variety of options are available, including width, height, and path of the 
SVG. Additionally, it is possible to extract the SVG image to a PDF, EPS, or 
PNG, exactly as it is rendered within the LaTeX document. Within the
documentation an example is given using an SVG created from the high energy
particle physics analysis package ROOT.
